# 🌟 Bank Marketing Predictor: Unveiling Customer Decisions 🏦

## 🎯 Project Overview

Welcome to the Bank Marketing Predictor! This project harnesses the power of machine learning to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on various demographic and behavioral factors. Using decision tree classification, we dive deep into the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to uncover hidden patterns and make accurate predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Comprehensive data analysis and visualization
- 🌳 Decision Tree Classifier implementation
- 🔍 Hyperparameter tuning using cost complexity pruning
- 📈 Performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## 📋 Dataset

The project uses the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset includes various features such as:

- Age
- Job type
- Marital status
- Education level
- Credit default status
- Balance
- Housing loan status
- Personal loan status
- Contact communication type
- Last contact day and month
- Campaign duration and frequency
- Previous campaign outcomes

## 🔍 Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess the dataset, handling categorical variables and scaling numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualize key features and their relationships with the target variable.
3. **Model Building**: Implement a Decision Tree Classifier and optimize it using cost complexity pruning.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using various metrics and visualize the results.

## 📊 Results

Our optimized Decision Tree Classifier achieved:

- Training Accuracy: 85.42%
- Testing Accuracy: 83.12%
- Precision (Test): 81.71%
- Recall (Test): 83.32%
- F1-score (Test): 82.51%

These results demonstrate the model's strong predictive power in determining whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Experiment with ensemble methods like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting
- Implement feature importance analysis to identify key predictors
- Develop a user-friendly web interface for real-time predictions
